Todos:

- error handling
- edit output

Critical missing features:

other:
	- game::send_to_llm is in urgent need of a refactor
	- check menu and dialog code consistency and refactor needs
	- check stuff like moving game creation into context, there is very similar code in multiple
	  places that may be deduplicatable

Missing features:

- editing world ingame
- image styles
- exporting world from save

Layout things to fix:

- image caption is way too far away from the image
