Todos:

- The image description lands in the TurnOutput::text field. Not the idea. Maybe in its own field.
- The Caption is in the wrong place in the gui
- the image should probably be 800x1200 or something like that, or let the AI decide.
- game::send_to_llm is in urgent need of a refactor
- cost of image generation is returned nowhere

Critical missing features:

- Summary
- skip to turns and load from there


Missing features:

- submit with ctrl+enter, or if need be, only with enter (probably much easier)
- access all information in the game, including hidden information, image descriptions, etc
- world editor
- appropriate error handling
- editing world ingame
- image styles
- exporting world from save
- save/load
- starting a new game without cli
- configure tokens without cli
- display of costs
- theming not working
