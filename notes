Todos:
	- when the llm violates the format, or the image generation fails,
	  the gamectx is left in AwaitingOutput or whatever. Just resetting
	  it isn't enough, because afterwards an image may come in. Or streaming
	  may be continued after the image failed. So I probably want to
	  attach an ID to these events, on error, reset the sub-state increase
	  that ID, and ignore incoming stuff from the invalidated request.
	
other:
	- game::send_to_llm is in urgent need of a refactor

Missing features:

- exporting world from save
- edit/delete worlds
- delete saves

Layout things to fix:

- image caption is way too far away from the image
