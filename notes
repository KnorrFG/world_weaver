Todos:

- game::send_to_llm is in urgent need of a refactor

Critical missing features:

- Summary
- skip to turns and load from there


Missing features:

- submit with ctrl+enter, or if need be, only with enter (probably much easier)
- access all information in the game, including hidden information, image descriptions, etc
- world editor
- appropriate error handling
- editing world ingame
- image styles
- exporting world from save
- save/load
- starting a new game without cli
- configure tokens without cli
- display of costs
- theming not working

Layout things to fix:

- text-area doesn't shrink. Sidebar does
- image caption is way too far away from the image
